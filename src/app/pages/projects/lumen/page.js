          During my work on client-facing apps like The StoryGraph, I faced a
          common struggle: user feedback is <strong>everywhere</strong>. Social
          media, app store reviews, emails â€” it all can be a <em>mess</em> to
          sift through. <br />
          <br />
          Even just 2 StoryGraph Instagram posts contained 300+ comments with
          insightful feedback! This wasn't just my problem â€” my team had faced
          the same struggles firsthand at their own workplaces, whether that was
          at large companies or small startups.

              <br />
              Strong motion and storytelling can make a platform feel real and

              More isnâ€™t always better! Oftentimes the simplest UI ends up being
              the most modular and scalable.

                Being a designer goes beyond just thinking about visuals.

              <strong>Always stay receptive to change.</strong>

              Putting so much time into your designs often means itâ€™s hard to
              let go of whatâ€™s not working. However, itâ€™s only through an open
              mind that can properly listen to and integrate user feedback you
              receive that you can ultimately make the best product for
              everyone.
